### Park Suggest

This application, written in C++, serves to offer a unique
way of exploring the National Park system. Users can sign in,
document where they have been in the country, and check a
variety of personal preferences about the parks. Through this
information, coupled with machine learning, users can receive
reccommendations for National Parks to visit.

The system utilizes the National Park API, OpenFrameworks,
ofXDatGui, and (most likely SQL and dlib C++).
